Ry's Side Project: creating an internet-based dashboard for useful stuff they like and check regularly


the goal of this little project is to create essentially what i want the mac dashboard
to look like -- a repository of useful stuff i check regularly 

as a starting point, i want to add the following: 

- mac hotkeys
- github commands 
- some kind of weather app
- a drum kit or other music creation thing 
- word counter 
- text analyzer 
- some kind of form i can take notes on
